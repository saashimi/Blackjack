Design decisions and issues
============================

The following assumptions were made in creating the game:
- One standard deck of 52 cards is used per game. At the conclusion of every win or 
loss scenario, a new 52 card deck is used. 
- The game does not allow for splitting conditions (i.e., when dealt two cards of the 
same rank, the player cannot play two different hands simultaneously.  This could be 
fixed in newer versions.
- No betting or point scoring is utilized in this iteration. 
- A merge sort function is included, but is not called upon in the game. It was included 
as a progress evaluation for this class, to demonstrate familiarity and knowldedge about 
sorting and recursive algorithms.  

A note to anyone using this code for their own purposes

There are probably smarter people to steal from, but it works for you, enjoy!
